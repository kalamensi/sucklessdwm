## Statusbar scripts

- Most of these script are meant to use with [dwmblocks-async](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/dwmblocks-async)
- To get colors you need to have your dwm pathed with [status2d](https://https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/status2d/) patch
- So if you are not using my build of dwm and **dmwblocks-acync** take some time to edit the scripts
